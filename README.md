# Cloud-and-Machine-Learning
Homeworks and projects for  CSCI-GA.3033-085 Cloud &amp; Machine Learning 

#### HW-1 : Survey of Cloud Computing Services
Survey and analysis of GCP, Amazon SageMaker and Microsoft Azure
#### HW-2 : Performance Study of Transformers <br>
Use profiling tools like nvprof,ncu and torchmetrics to profile the forward pass of a Transformer model
#### HW-3 : Deepdive into Docker <br>
Understand the key elements of Docker and containerization: Docker File, DockerHub and building a image, Docker Logs etc
#### HW-4 : Model Trainig and Inference on GCP using Persistent Volume Storage <br>
Use GKE (Google Kubernetes Enginee) to create clusters and use PVC for training and inference on cloud and a flask app for running the application.
#### Project-1 : ImageNet Analysis <br>
Analyze the performance of CNNs (VGG11, VGG13 & VGG19) run on A100 and V100 GPUs. NCU and nvprof for kernel profiling, hand estimation of FLOPs and roofline modelling.
